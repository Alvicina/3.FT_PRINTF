The aim of this project is to implement a handmade printf function so that we get to grasp the logic behind variadic functions.

This project was first done and finished in a different repo to this one (42 camps provides us with independent repos for each project). Once finished, the project was then copied to my personal repo in gitHub.

The FT_Printf function as well as the get_next_line function is included in my libft library. It is not part of the libft project requirements but once you pass FT_Printf project, 42 camps allow us to use it as part of our libft functions in projects down the road.

In the following pdf you can find the project requirements as specified by 42 campus: [README_FT_PRINTF.pdf](https://github.com/Alvicina/FT_PRINTF/files/15310007/README_FT_PRINTF.pdf)

The following snapshot if proof that the project was succesfully done:
